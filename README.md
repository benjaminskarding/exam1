# FED1 Project Exam 1


Project Description

Overview:

My project is a travel blog for a globetrotter who shares a variety of posts. These range from portraits of unique individuals he meets, to activities he participates in, and traditional travel posts like sightseeing.


Features:

Categorization and Tagging: Each post can be categorized and tagged, giving readers a clear idea of the post's content. Categories might include portraits, unique skills, or general travel experiences.

Admin Panel: The admin panel is designed to be user-friendly, visually pleasing, and intuitive. While not overly elaborate, it avoids an outdated appearance.

Post Creation: The blog includes a feature to create posts directly from the UI, which, while not originally required, was implemented to add logical functionality.

Security: Admin functionality is secured by utilizing javascript to hide the admin panel navigation (including the actual href) until an admin is logged in. Additionally, JavaScript continuously checks for admin verification, redirecting unauthorized users.



Limitations:
Due to API constraints, the original design that included multiple subtitles and images per post was not fully realized. This is reflected in the differences between the initial Figma design and the final implementation. Additionally, budget constraints prevented updates to the Figma design.


Design Approach:
The design process was straightforward once the concept and landing page were finalized. I prioritized coding and overcoming technical challenges over creating a detailed Figma prototype, as this was not a collaborative project.


Future Improvements:
For a real-world scenario, the admin panel URL could be made harder to guess for added security. The project could also be enhanced with support for multiple subtitles and images per post, aligning with the original design vision.
